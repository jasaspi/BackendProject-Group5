Optimizing electric car charging. An application retrieves the time when electricity is cheapest and optimizes charging times accordingly.

Control of electric car charging:

   1. The user enters the departure time for the next trip and the estimated distance to be driven.
   2. The program retrieves electricity prices for the next 24 hours via an API.
   3. The required number of charging hours is set relative to the distance to be driven, and the cheapest charging times between the current time and departure time are selected.
